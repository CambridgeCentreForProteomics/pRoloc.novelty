Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of
vital importance to fully understand context specific protein
function. Some proteins can be found with a single location within a
cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can
dynamically relocalise, or reside within an unknown functional
compartment. These considerations lead to uncertainty in associating a
protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based
spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to
assign proteins to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient
profiles. However, such methods fail to quantify uncertainty
associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate the
framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a
Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to
assign proteins probabilistically to sub-cellular niches, thus
proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations,
with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation
(EM) algorithm (coined TAGM-MAP, for *maximum a posteriori*), as well
as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (coined TAGM-MCMC). Our methodology allows
proteome-wide uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer
to the analysis of spatial proteomics. Our framework is flexible,
allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new
modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods
perform competitively with current state-of-the art machine learning
methods, whilst simultaneously providing more information. We
highlight several examples where classification based on the support
vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty
quantification using our approach provides biologically intriguing
results.  To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian model of
MS-based spatial proteomics data.

Below, we start by loading packages that are needed to execute the
code in this vignette and set the default colour to semi-transparent.

```{r env, message=FALSE}
library("pRoloc")
library("pRolocdata")
require("reshape")
require("ggplot2")
require("coda")

setStockcol(paste0(getStockcol(), 90))
```

# The *TAGM-MAP* method

We will use a subsest of the `tan2009r1` dataset from the
`Biocexptpkg("pRolocdata")` to illustrate the TAGM-MAP method

```{r tan}
data(tan2009r1)
set.seed(1)
tan2009r1 <- tan2009r1[sample(nrow(tan2009r1), 400), ]
```

The first step is to generate the model parameters using the
`tagmMapTrain` function, that will generate an instance of class
`MAPParams`.

```{r tagmMapTrain}
p <- tagmMapTrain(tan2009r1)
p
```

The results of the modelling can be visualised with the `plotEllipse`
function. The outer ellipse contains 99% of the total probability
whilst the middle and inner ellipses contain 95% and 90% of the
probability respectively. The centres of the clusters are represented
by black circumpunct (circled dot).

```{r plotEllipse}
plotEllipse(tan2009r1, p)
```

The `MAPParams` object can now be used to classify the proteins of
unknown localisation using `tagmPredict`.


```{r tagmPredict}
res <- tagmPredict(tan2009r1, p)
```

The new feature variables that are generated are:

- `tagm.map.allocation`: the TAGM-MAP predictions for the most likely
  protein sub-cellular allocation.

```{r alloc}
table(fData(res)$tagm.map.allocation)
```

- `tagm.map.probability`: the posterior probability for the protein
  sub-cellular allocations.

```{r prob}
summary(fData(res)$tagm.map.probability)
```

- `tagm.map.outlier`: the probability for that protein to belong
  to the outlier component rather than any annotated component.

```{r oultlier}
summary(fData(res)$tagm.map.outlier)
```

# The *TAGM-MCMC* method

We will use a subsest of the `tan2009r1` dataset from the
`r Biocexptpkg("pRolocdata")` to illustrate the TAGM-MCMC method

The first step is run two MCMC chains for a few iterations of the
algorithm using the `tagmMcmcTrain` function.  This function will
generate a object of class `MCMCParams`. The summary slot of which is
currently empty.

```{r tagmMcmcTrain}
library("pRoloc")
p <- tagmMcmcTrain(object = tan2009r1, numIter = 3,
                   burnin = 1, thin = 1, numChains = 2)
p
```

Information for each MCMC chain is contained within the chains
slot. This information can be accessed manually if need. The function
`MCMCProcess` populates the summary slot of the `MCMCParams` object

```{r tagmMCMCProcess}
p <- tagmMcmcProcess(p)
p
```

The summary slot has now been populated to include basic summaries of
the `MCMCChains`, such as allocations and localisation
probabilities. Protein information can be appended to the feature
columns of the `MSnSet` by using the `tagmPredict` function, which
extracts the required information from the summary slot of the
`MCMCParams` object.

```{r tagmMcmcPredict}
res <- tagmPredict(object = tan2009r1, params = p)
```

One can access new features variables:

- `tagm.mcmc.allocation`: the TAGM-MCMC prediction for the most likely
  protein sub-cellular annotation.

```{r}
table(fData(res)$tagm.mcmc.allocation)
```

- `tagm.mcmc.probability`: the posterior probability for the protein
  sub-cellular allocations.

```{r}
summary(fData(res)$tagm.mcmc.probability)
```
As well as other useful summaries of the MCMC methods:

- `tagm.mcmc.outlier` the posterior probability for the protein
  to belong to the outlier component.

- `tagm.mcmc.probability.lowerquantile` and  `tagm.mcmc.probability.upperquantile`
 are the lower and upper boundaries to the equi-tailed 95% credible interval
 of `tagm.mcmc.probability`.

-  `tagm.mcmc.mean.shannon` a Monte-Carlo averaged shannon entropy,
   which is a measure of uncertainty in the allocations.

 The following section is included statically, as it requires a
 relatively large dataset (nearly 400MB), that we don't want to
 include in a package for space requirements nor download for time
 requirements.

 Also needs to copy the images from inst/extdocs/figure into
 vignettes/Figures.

# *TAGM-MCMC*, in details

This section explains how to manually manipulate the MCMC output of
the Bayesian model TAGM-MCMC applied to spatial proteomics data
[@Crook:2018]. First, we load the MCMC data (as produced by
`tagmMcmcTrain`) to be used and the packages required for analysis.

The `tanTagm.rda` file is nearly 400MB large and isn't direcly
distributed in a package but can be downloaded from the
[http://bit.ly/tagm-mcmc](http://bit.ly/tagm-mcmc) google drive to
reproduce the following analyses. Alternatively, to avoid manual
intervention, the following code chunk downloads the file from an
alternative server:


```r
destdir <- tempdir()
destfile <- file.path(destdir, "tanTagm.rda")
download.file("http://proteome.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/lgatto/files/tanTagm.rda",
              destfile)
load(destfile)
```


```r
## Load tanTagm data containing the MCMC analysis, which is assumed to
## be available in the working directory.
load("tanTagm.rda")
tanTagm
```

```
## Object of class "MCMCParams"
## Method: TAGM.MCMC
## Number of chains: 4
```

We now load the example data for which we performed this Bayesian
analysis. This Drosophila embryo spatial proteomics experiment is
from [@Tan2009].


```r
data(tan2009r1) ## get data from pRolocdata
```

The `tanTagm` data was produce by executing the `tagmMcmcTrain`
function. $20000$ iterations were performed, automatically discarding
$5000$ iterations for burnin, sub-sampling the chains by $10$ and
running a total of $4$ chains in parallel. This results in $4$ chains
each with $1500$ MCMC iterations.


```r
tanTagm <- tagmMcmcTrain(object = tan2009r1,
                         numIter = 20000,
                         burnin = 5000,
                         thin = 10,
                         numChains = 4)
```

## Data exploration and convergence diagnostics

Using parallel chains for analysis allows us to diagnose whether our
MCMC algorithm has converged (or not). The number of parallel MCMC
chains used in this analysis was 4.


```r
## Get number of chains
nChains <- length(tanTagm@chains)
nChains
```

```
## [1] 4
```

The following code chunks sets up a manual convegence diagnostic
check. We make use of objects and methods in the package
*[coda](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=coda)* to peform this analysis [@coda].  We
calculate the total number of outliers at each iteration of each chain
and if the algorithm has converged this number should be the same (or
very similar) across all 4 chains. We can observe this by sight by
producing trace plots for each MCMC chain.


```r
## Convergence diagnostic to see if more we need to discard any
## iterations or entire chains.
outlierTotal <- vector("list", length = nChains)

## Compute the number of outliers for each iteration for each chain
for (j in seq_len(nChains)) {
  mc <- pRoloc:::chains(tanTagm)[[j]]
  outlierTotal[[j]] <- coda::mcmc(colSums(mc@Outlier))
}

## Carefully using coda S3 objects to produce trace plots and histograms
plot(outlierTotal[[1]], col = "blue", main = "Chain 1")
```

![plot of chunk mcmc-outlier](figure/mcmc-outlier-1.png)

```r
plot(outlierTotal[[2]], col = "red", main = "Chain 2")
```

![plot of chunk mcmc-outlier](figure/mcmc-outlier-2.png)

```r
plot(outlierTotal[[3]], col = "green", main = "Chain 3")
```

![plot of chunk mcmc-outlier](figure/mcmc-outlier-3.png)

```r
plot(outlierTotal[[4]], col = "orange", main = "Chain 4")
```

![plot of chunk mcmc-outlier](figure/mcmc-outlier-4.png)

We can use the *[coda](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=coda)* package to produce
summaries of our chains. Here is the `coda` summary for the first
chain.


```r
## all chains average around 360 outliers
summary(outlierTotal[[1]])
```

```
##
## Iterations = 1:1500
## Thinning interval = 1
## Number of chains = 1
## Sample size per chain = 1500
##
## 1. Empirical mean and standard deviation for each variable,
##    plus standard error of the mean:
##
##           Mean             SD       Naive SE Time-series SE
##        357.301         13.864          0.358          0.358
##
## 2. Quantiles for each variable:
##
##  2.5%   25%   50%   75% 97.5%
##   329   348   357   367   384
```

In this case our chains looks very good. They all oscillate around an
average of 360 outliers. There is no observed monotonicity in our
output. However, for a more rigorous and unbiased analysis of
convergence we can calculate the Gelman diagnostics using the
*[coda](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=coda)* package
[@Gelman:1992,@Brools:1998]. This statistics is often refered to as
$\hat{R}$ or the potential scale reduction factor. The idea of the
Gelman diagnostics is to so compare the inter and intra chain
variance. The ratio of these quantities should be close to one.  The
actual statistics computed is more complicated, but we do not go
deeper here and a more detailed and in depth discussion can be found
in the references. The *[coda](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=coda)* package also
reports the $95\%$ upper confidence interval of the $\hat{R}$
statistic.


```r
## Can check gelman diagnostic for convergence (values less than <1.05
## are good for convergence)
gelman.diag(outlierTotal) # the Upper C.I. is 1 so mcmc has clearly converged
```

```
## Potential scale reduction factors:
##
##      Point est. Upper C.I.
## [1,]          1          1
```

We can also look at the Gelman diagnostics statistics for pairs of chains.


```r
## We can also check individual pairs of chains for convergence
gelman.diag(outlierTotal[1:2]) # the upper C.I is 1.01
```

```
## Potential scale reduction factors:
##
##      Point est. Upper C.I.
## [1,]          1       1.01
```

```r
gelman.diag(outlierTotal[c(1,3)]) # the upper C.I is 1
```

```
## Potential scale reduction factors:
##
##      Point est. Upper C.I.
## [1,]          1          1
```

```r
gelman.diag(outlierTotal[3:4]) # the upper C.I is 1
```

```
## Potential scale reduction factors:
##
##      Point est. Upper C.I.
## [1,]          1          1
```

## Manually manipulating MCMC chains

This section explains how to manually manipulate our MCMC chains.

### Discarding entire chains

Here we demonstrate how to discard chains that may not have converged.
Including chains that have not converged in downstream analysis is
likely to lead to nonsensical results. As an example, we demonstrate
how to remove the second chain from our domwnstream analysis.


```r
## Our chains look really good but let us discard chain 2, as an
## example in case we didn't believe it had converged.  It would be
## possible to remove more than one chain e.g. to remove 2 and 4 using
## c(2, 4).
removeChain <- 2
newTanMcmc <- tanTagm[seq_len(nChains)[-removeChain]]

## Let check that it looks good
newTanMcmc
```

```
## Object of class "MCMCParams"
## Method: TAGM.MCMC
## Number of chains: 3
```

```r
length(newTanMcmc) == (nChains - length(removeChain))
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
## Let have a look at our first chain
tanChain1 <- pRoloc:::chains(newTanMcmc)[[1]]
tanChain1@n ## Chain has 1500 iterations.
```

```
## [1] 1500
```

We could repeat the convergence diagnostics of the previous section to
check for convergence again.

## Discarding iterations from each chain

We are happy that our chains have conveged. Let us recap where our
analysis up until this point. We have 3 chains each with 1500
iterations. We now demonstrate how to discard iterations from
individual chains, since they may have converged some number of
iteration into the analysis. Let us use only the iterations of last
half of the remaining three chains.  This also speeds up computations,
however too few iterations in the further analysis is likely to lead
to poor results. We find that using at least $1000$ iterations for
downstream analysis leads to stable results.



```r
## We need to clear this section up with a new function

n <- (tanChain1@n)/2 # Number of iterations to keep 750
K <- tanChain1@K # Number of components
N <- tanChain1@N # Number of Proteins

## Create storage for .MCMCChain
.MCMCChainlist <- vector("list", length = length(newTanMcmc))

for(j in seq_len(length(newTanMcmc))) {

  tanChain <- pRoloc:::chains(newTanMcmc)[[j]]
  .ComponentParam <- tanChain@ComponentParam # This won't change

  ## Subset MCMC iterations
  retain <- seq.int(n + 1, tanChain@n) # retain 750 samples

  ## Check correct number of iterations
  stopifnot(ncol(tanChain@Component[, retain]) == n) # Second entry is 750

  ## Subset functions
  .Component <- tanChain@Component[, retain]
  .ComponentProb <- tanChain@ComponentProb[, retain, ]
  .Outlier <- tanChain@Outlier[, retain]
  .OutlierProb <- tanChain@OutlierProb[, retain, ]

  ## We can now create a new object of class MCMCChains
  ## make MCMCChain object
  .MCMCChainlist[[j]] <- pRoloc:::.MCMCChain(n = as.integer(n),
                                             K = K,
                                             N = N,
                                             Component = .Component,
                                             ComponentProb = .ComponentProb,
                                             Outlier = .Outlier,
                                             OutlierProb = .OutlierProb,
                                             ComponentParam = .ComponentParam)

}

## Construct class MCMCChains
.ans <- pRoloc:::.MCMCChains(chains = .MCMCChainlist)
tanTagmparams <- pRoloc:::.MCMCParams(method = "TAGM.MCMC",
                                      chains = .ans,
                                      priors = tanTagm@priors,
                                      summary = pRoloc:::.MCMCSummary())
```

tanTagmParams is now an object of class `MCMCParams` with 3 chains
each with 750 iterations.



```r
## Check tanTagmParams object
pRoloc:::chains(tanTagmparams)[[1]]
```

```
## Object of class "MCMCChain"
##  Number of components: 11
##  Number of proteins: 677
##  Number of iterations: 750
```

```r
pRoloc:::chains(tanTagmparams)[[2]]
```

```
## Object of class "MCMCChain"
##  Number of components: 11
##  Number of proteins: 677
##  Number of iterations: 750
```

```r
pRoloc:::chains(tanTagmparams)[[3]]
```

```
## Object of class "MCMCChain"
##  Number of components: 11
##  Number of proteins: 677
##  Number of iterations: 750
```

## Procesing and summarising MCMC results

### Populating the summary slot

The summary slot of the `tanTagmparams` is currently empty, we can now
populate the summary slot of `tanTagmparams` using the
`tagmMcmcProcess` function.


```r
## This will automatically pool chains to produce summary (easy to
## create single summaries by subsetting)
tanTagmparams <- tagmMcmcProcess(tanTagmparams)

## Let look at this object
summary(tanTagmparams@summary@posteriorEstimates)
```

For a sanity check, let us re-check the diagnostics.  This is
re-computed when we excute the `tagmMcmcProcess` function and located
in a `diagnostics` slot.

### Appending results to MSnSet

The `pRoloc` function `tagmPredict` can be used to append protein MCMC
results to the feature data of our object of class `MSnSet`. This
creates new columns in the feature data of the `MSnSet`, which can be
used for final analysis of our data.


```r
## We can now use tagmPredict
tan2009r1 <- tagmPredict(tan2009r1, params = tanTagmparams)
```

## Visualising MCMC results

### Visualising prediction results

Now that we have processed our chains, checked convergence and
summarised the results into our `MSnset`; we can interrogate our data
for novel biological results. We use the `plot2D` function to view the
probabilitic allocations of proteins to sub-cellular niches.


```r
## Create prediction point size
ptsze <- exp(fData(tan2009r1)$tagm.mcmc.probability) - 1

## Create plot2D with pointer scaled with probability
plot2D(tan2009r1, fcol = "tagm.mcmc.allocation", cex = ptsze,
       main = "protein pointer scaled with posterior localisation probability")

addLegend(object = tan2009r1, where = "topleft", cex = 0.5)
```

### Visualising allocation uncertainty

By using the Shannon entropy we can globally visualise
uncertainty. Proteins can be scaled with their Shannon entropy and we
note that proteins with high Shannon entropy have high uncertainty.


```r
## Visualise shannon entropy
## Create prediction point size
ptsze2 <- 3 * fData(tan2009r1)$tagm.mcmc.mean.shannon
plot2D(tan2009r1, fcol = "tagm.mcmc.allocation", cex = ptsze2,
       main = "protein pointer scaled with Shannon entropy")
addLegend(object = tan2009r1, where = "topleft", cex = 0.5)
```

### Extracting proteins of interest

Our data can be interrogated in other ways. We might be interested in
all the proteins that were confidently assigned as outliers. A GO
enrichment analysis could be performed on these proteins, since they
may reveal biologically interesting results.


```r
## Get outlier lists proteins with probability greater than 0.95 of being outlier
outliers <- rownames(tan2009r1)[fData(tan2009r1)$tagm.mcmc.outlier > 0.95]
outliers
```

### Extracting information for individual proteins

We might be interested in analysing the localisation of individual
proteins and interrogating which other potential localisations these
proteins might have.  A violin plot of the probabilistic allocation of
the following protein Q9VCK0 is visualised. This demonstrates and
quantifies the uncertainty in the allocation of this protein.


```r
## We can make this into a function
Q9VCK0 <- as.data.frame(tanChain@ComponentProb["Q9VCK0",,])
colnames(Q9VCK0) <- getMarkerClasses(tan2009r1)
Q9VCK0melt <- melt(Q9VCK0)
```

```
## Using  as id variables
```

```r
colnames(Q9VCK0melt) <- c("Organelle","Probability")
gg2 <- ggplot(Q9VCK0melt,
              aes(Organelle, Probability, width = (Probability))) +
    geom_violin(aes(fill = Organelle), scale = "width")
gg2 <- gg2 + theme_bw() +
    scale_fill_manual(values = getStockcol()[1:14]) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
          axis.title.x = element_blank())
gg2 <- gg2 +
    ylab("Membership Probability") +
    ggtitle(paste0("Distribution of Subcellular Membership for Protein Q9VCK0" ))
gg2 <- gg2 +
    theme(legend.position="none")
print(gg2)
```
